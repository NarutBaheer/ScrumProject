# Product Backlog for Bank ATM Simulator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Product Backlog for the Bank ATM Simulator project. As the future of banking moves increasingly towards digital solutions, our team at the American University of Afghanistan is dedicated to contributing to this evolution through the creation of a sophisticated ATM simulator. This project serves not just as an academic endeavor but as a stepping stone towards enhancing the technological landscape of banking systems globally.

Our simulator is designed to mirror the complexities and functionalities of a real-world ATM, providing an immersive and interactive platform for error detection, handling, and analysis. The following backlog outlines a comprehensive list of features and tasks prioritized to guide the development of a robust tool that seeks to improve the reliability and efficiency of ATM services.

As the product owner, my vision is to steer our team's efforts in delivering a system that not only meets but exceeds the standards of quality and user experience. This backlog will be the blueprint of our progress, open to adaptation and refinement as we delve deeper into the project's lifecycle.

The items listed are categorized by priority, and each carries significant value towards achieving our ultimate goal - a Bank ATM Simulator that can serve as a critical instrument in error resolution and quality assurance for the financial services industry.

Let's embark on this journey of innovation and learning together.
