# Bank ATM Simulator

## Project Overview

We are a team of students from the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) committed to implementing the SCRUM methodology while developing a desktop-based ATM simulator. This project aims to enhance error handling and quality assurance processes in banking systems by providing a highly realistic ATM simulation experience. Our simulator replicates all standard components and functionalities of a typical ATM, including additional features for user interaction and engagement.

### Objective

The primary goal of this ATM simulator is to serve as a robust tool for error identification, resolution, and overall quality improvement in ATM services. By simulating real-world scenarios and transactions, it provides valuable insights into user experience and system reliability, enhancing customer satisfaction and trust in our banking services.

### Key Features

- **Realistic ATM Interface:** Simulates the look and feel of an actual ATM, including the card insertion slot, keypad for PIN entry, and options for cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, and other transactions.
- **Comprehensive Component Simulation:** Includes all physical and interactive components, such as the cash dispenser, receipt printer, and screen prompts.
- **Error Handling Mechanisms:** Simulates various error conditions to assist in quality checks and troubleshooting.
- **Bank Sign-up Forms:** Allows users to simulate signing up for a bank account or other banking services.
- **Desktop Compatibility:** Designed for easy deployment and use on desktop systems.
