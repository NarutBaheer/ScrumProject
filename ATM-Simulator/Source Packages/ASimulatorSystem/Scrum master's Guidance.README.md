# Project Source Code Submission

## Introduction

Welcome, team! This repository is designated for the submission of our project's source code, including all Java classes and associated files. It's crucial that we maintain an organized and accessible structure for our codebase to facilitate efficient collaboration and review.

## Submission Guidelines

### Uploading Source Code

- Please ensure that your source code is thoroughly commented and follows our coding standards.
- Organize your files in a logical structure. Use folders to separate different modules or components of the project.
- Before uploading any Java class, ensure it compiles and runs as expected to prevent integration issues.

### Naming Conventions

- Use meaningful names for all files and folders, reflecting their purpose or functionality within the project.
- For Java classes, use UpperCamelCase. For example, `UserProfile.java`.
- For directories, use lower-kebab-case. For example, `payment-processing/`.

### Commit Messages

- Write clear and concise commit messages, stating what was added, changed, or fixed.
- Begin the commit message with a verb in the imperative mood, e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update".

### Pull Requests

- When you believe your component is ready for integration, create a pull request against the main branch.
- Assign a team member to review your pull request. Ensure it passes all checks and does not introduce conflicts.

## Collaboration

- Stay in regular communication with the team. Share updates on your progress and any challenges you're facing.
- If you need assistance or a review, don't hesitate to ask for help. Collaboration is key to our project's success.

## Final Notes

Remember, this is a collaborative effort. Maintaining a clean, organized, and professional codebase is in everyone's best interest.

Let's aim for quality and efficiency. Happy coding, team!
